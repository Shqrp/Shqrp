### shqrp.

it was about time I updated this README since I wrote it 3 years ago at 14 years young.
*well, not much has changed*:
- I'm still a student
- I still have more failed projects than successful ones (wait, I don't think I have successful projects ***yet***)
- theoretically I shouldn't be a beginner anymore, but I don't really think that's true lmao

now I should be devoting my entire free time on @nodocapp, but man, I'm tryin ok. if you wanna help me in this or wanna know more, please contact me at this [email](mailto:shqrp@shqrp.dev)

so anyways, uhm, I have a [website](https://shqrp.dev), but I don't know how much that domain is going to last considering the funds to maintain it aren't really stable (it's fucking $10 but I can't be bothered). should I improve it to make it my own business card? yes. will I do it? why the hell is that even a question, ofc not.
