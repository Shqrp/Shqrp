_Yes, I'm talking to you, you visiting my profile..._

First of all, **welcome**! Second of all... I mean, I think I should list all my things and favourites and projects, yeah, those things. Well. **let's go on then**!

- Projects I'm (_present_) working on: 
  - [Next](https://github.com/Nebula-Development/Next): A multi-purpose Discord bot that I had to start over a dozen times 'cause of my poor knowledge of Node.js and the unfortunate death of [Klasa](https://github.com/dirigeants/klasa).
- Favourite past projects: 
  - [MultiDeath](https://github.com/Shqrp/MultiDeath): A Windows virus coded in VB.NET that will basically make your computer unusable, even though it's really simple.
- **Miserably failed** projects: 
  - [Launchpad](https://github.com/Shqrp/Launchpad): A program that was supposed to act like a Novation Launchpad using only the computer keyboard, but because of my ignorance at the time, basically not knowing the existence of arrays and other things, it turned out to be a 4000+ lines .vb file that I didn't even finish and was a mess to continue working on.
  - [Uploadgram Uploader](https://github.com/Shqrp/Uploadgram-Uploader): An uploader that was supposed to work for [Uploadgram](https://uploadgram.me), but then, due to my poor knowledge of VB.NET and bad things happening to Uploadgram (which I'm not gonna talk about), I stopped working on it.
  - [AutoBump](https://github.com/Shqrp/AutoBump): My first ever Discord bot, that it had one job: automatically bump a server on ServerMate without having to pay anything, but it turned out ServerMate was smart enough to block out messages from bots (I mean, doesn't like every bot do that, ***smh***).
  
 Uhm, yeah you can see there are more **failed projects** then successful projects, but I don't really care to be honest, because I'm a beginner and coding is all about trial-and-error.
 
 I hope you enjoyed my profile page as much as I did writing it!
